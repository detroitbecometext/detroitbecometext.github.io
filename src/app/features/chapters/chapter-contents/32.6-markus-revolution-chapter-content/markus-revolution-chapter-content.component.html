            <span class="name">Markus</span>: Today, November 11th 2038, is the
            day the android people rose up against their oppressors. We've been
            fighting since dawn to liberate our fellow androids from the camps.
            We won't cease hostilities until we are free and negotiations begin
            to grant us equal rights. There are millions of us and we will stop
            at nothing.

            kept our pain to ourselves. We suffered in silence... But now the
            time has come for us to raise our heads up, and tell humans who we
            really are. To tell them that we are people too! In fact, we're a
            nation. A nation that has earned the right to live in freedom. And
            today... Today begins the most challenging moment in our fight.
            Today begins a new struggle. We showed them that we can prevail, so
            now they must negotiate with us as equals. If they really want
            peace, they must free all of us! From every camp across this
            country! They must grant us civil rights and accept equality among
            humans and androids. Today will live forever in our memories,
