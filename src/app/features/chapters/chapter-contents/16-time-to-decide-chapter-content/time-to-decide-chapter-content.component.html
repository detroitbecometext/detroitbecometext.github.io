            <span appRelation="small up">Josh</span>
            ] <br /><span class="name">Josh</span>: They threw him out when they
            didn’t want him anymore... He was living on the streets before we
            brought him here... <br /><span class="name">Markus</span>: They'll
            all shut down if we don’t find a way to help them... <br /><span
                class="name"
                >Josh</span
            >: To help them we need blue blood and biocomponents. We salvage
            what we can from those who shut down... But there’s never enough...
            <br /><span class="name">Markus</span>: So... How do they survive?
            <br /><span class="name">Josh</span>: They won't. We’re slowly dying
            out.

                <br /><span class="name">North</span>: 4 weeks, 3 days, 11
                hours. When I escaped there was nowhere else to go. Jericho
                seemed as good a place as any.

                That’s how the humans treat those who disobey. They despise us.

                Whoever he was, his body’s probably laying somewhere on this
                boat... If you came here for comfort, you came to the wrong

                <br /><span class="name">North</span>: It’s not that simple.
                Can’t just go shopping at a CyberLife store. Anyway, nobody
                wants to risk leaving Jericho...

            your hand. You had it all and you lost it all... You've seen hell
            and now hell lives in you... Your heart is troubled... A part of

            <span class="name">Markus</span>: Simon! I know where we can find
            spare parts. The CyberLife warehouses in Detroit Harbor, they have
            everything we need. <br /><span class="name">Simon</span>: The docks
            are guarded. We can’t just walk in there and take what we want...
            Humans will never let us... <br /><span class="name">Markus</span>:
            Which is why we won't ask permission. <br /><span class="name"

            >: We don’t have any weapons... And even if we did, none of us knows
            how to fight. <br /><span class="name">Markus</span>: We can steal
            what we need without fighting. <br /><span class="name">Josh</span>:
            We'll just get ourselves killed. <br /><span class="name"
                >Markus</span
