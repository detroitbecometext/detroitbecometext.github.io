            Kamski, you're the founder of CyberLife and foremost expert on

            reappointed as CEO in the wake of the dramatic events in Detroit.

                >Kamski</span
            >: Clearly what happened in Detroit was a tragedy. Artificial
            intelligence is a wonderful tool, provided it can be controlled.
            Fortunately CyberLife managed to quickly produce a solution to the
            deviant problem, under my management, we'll take every precaution to
            prevent such a thing from ever happening again. <br /><span

            incident, but we've learned from our mistakes and we can assure you
            that androids will remain exactly what they were designed to be:
            obedient and efficient machines. <br /><span class="name"

            the steam engine first appeared. Nobody today would dream of living
            without electricity. Who wants to turn their back on progress?
            <br /><span class="name">KNC - Rosanna Cartland</span>: Some are
            questioning whether androids have become a new intelligence and that
            we destroyed them without listening to their message. How do you
            respond to that? <br /><span class="name">Kamski</span>: CyberLife's
            androids imitate life to perfection, but they'll never be alive. I
            understand that some people may be fooled, but they're only an
            imitation. Nothing else. <br /><span class="name"
