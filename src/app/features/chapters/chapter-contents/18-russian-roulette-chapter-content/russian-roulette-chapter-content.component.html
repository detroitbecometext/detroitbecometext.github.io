            Warren issued an official warning to Russia in her speech to
            Congress today, where she demanded that all Russian troops withdraw
            from the Arctic region immediately. The Kremlin has yet to respond,
            but this is clearly a new escalation in the conflict. Many experts
            are suggesting the specter of a third world war draws closer every
            day...
