            <br /><span class="name">KNC - Rosanna Cartland</span>: There is
            widespread shock following the android attack on Detroit's Stratford
            Tower. The machines recorded a video message and broadcast what can
            only be described as demands on the city's public screens. It's
            still unclear whether these attacks can be explained by
            malfunctions, or if some organization is behind them. So far
            CyberLife has refused to comment, but we can expect more information
            in the following hours...
