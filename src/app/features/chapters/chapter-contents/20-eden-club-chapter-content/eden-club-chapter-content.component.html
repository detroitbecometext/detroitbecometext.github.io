        <p>
            <span class="name">Hank</span>: Aw... Feels like somebody's playing
            with a drill inside my skull... You sure this is the place?
            <br /><span class="name">Connor</span>: It's the address in the
            report. <br /><span class="name">Hank</span>: Right... Okay... Let's
            get going. Jesus... Sexiest androids in town... Now I know why you
            insisted on coming here ! Oh, boy...
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Looking at the androids for too long</strong>
            <br /><span class="name">Hank</span>: Connor! The fuck are you
            doin'? <br /><span class="name">Connor</span>: Coming, Lieutenant.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Listening to Ben</strong>
            <br /><span class="name">Manager</span>: You're not gonna take my
            license, are you ? I mean, ha, I had nothing to do with this!
            <br /><span class="name">Ben</span>: The investigation's ongoing,
            sir, I can't tell you anything for the moment. Hey, Hank!
            <br /><span class="name">Hank</span>: Hey, Ben. How's it goin'?
            <br /><span class="name">Ben</span>: It's that room there. Oh, uh,
            by the way... Gavin's in there too. <br /><span class="name"
                >Hank</span
            >: Oh, great! A dead body and an asshole, just what I needed...
        </p>

        <h2>Inside the room</h2>

        <p>
            <span class="name">Gavin</span>: Lieutenant Anderson and his plastic
            pet... The fuck are you two doin' here? <br /><span class="name"
                >Connor</span
            >: We've been assigned all cases involving androids. <br /><span

                >Gavin</span
            >: Oh, yeah? Well, you're wasting your time. Just some pervert who,
            uh, got more action than he could handle. <br /><span class="name"
                >Hank</span
            >: We'll have a look anyway, if you don't mind. <br /><span

                >Gavin</span
            >: Come on, let's go... It's uh... starting to stink of booze in
            here... <br /><span class="name">Chris</span>: Night, Lieutenant.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Analysing the blood</strong>
            <br /><span class="name">Hank</span>: Whoa! Hey! Hey! Hey! Argh,
            Connor, you're so disgusting... Think I'm gonna puke again...
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Hank looking at driver's license</strong>
            <br /><span class="name">Hank</span>: Driver's license says: Michael
            Graham... A credit card, cash in the wallet... Picture of his wife
            and two daughters... I wouldn't want to make that call...
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Reconstructing</strong>
            <br /><span class="name">Connor</span>: He didn't die of a heart
            attack, he was strangled. <br /><span class="name">Hank</span>:
            Yeah, I saw the bruising on the neck. Doesn't prove anything though.
            Could've been rough play... <br /><span class="name">Connor</span>:
            We're missing something here... <br /><span class="name">Hank</span
            >: Think you can read the android's memory? Maybe you can see what
            happened... <br /><span class="name">Connor</span>: I can try...

        <p>
            <strong>Connecting to the android</strong>
            <br /><span class="name">Connor</span>: The only way to access its
            memory is to reactivate it. <br /><span class="name">Hank</span>:
            Think you can do it? <br /><span class="name">Connor</span>: It's
            badly damaged... If I can, it'll only be for a minute, maybe less...
            I just hope it's long enough to learn something.
