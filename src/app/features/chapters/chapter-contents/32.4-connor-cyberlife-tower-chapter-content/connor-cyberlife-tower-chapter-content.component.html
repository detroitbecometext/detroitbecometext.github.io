                                            Lieutenant. A truck skidded on a
                                            sheet of ice and your car rolled
                                            over. Cole needed emergency surgery
                                            but no human was available to do
                                            it... So an android had to take care
                                            of him... Cole didn't make it.
                                            That's why you hate androids. You
