        <h1>President Warren talks to journalists</h1>
        <p>
            <span class="name">President Warren</span>: At 6AM this morning, a
            national curfew was declared. Civilian movement will be strictly
            controlled, the right to assembly is suspended, all electronic
            communications are restricted, and I have granted enhanced powers to
            our security agencies. In addition to these measures, all androids
            must be handed over to the authorities immediately. Temporary camps
            are being set up in all our major cities to contain and destroy
            them. I am now asking all civilians to co-operate with the
            authorities, and rest assured that everything in our power is being
            done to guarantee the security of our nation.
        </p>

                That's absurd. There's absolutely no connection. Androids are
                not living beings. All we are doing is destroying defective

                Our forces are now combing the streets to ensure that none got
                through the net. We are going to find them one by one and

                reliability came into doubt, we have called the National Guard
                for reinforcement. Our armed forces are fully operational and

                        public opinion seems to have become increasingly
                        favorable to the deviants, particularly since they've
                        adopted a peaceful approach. How do you feel about this?

                        opinion is one thing, the security of the state is
                        another. These deviants are dangerous and my highest
                        priority is to protect the American people.

                        public opinion seems to be particularly hostile to the
                        deviants because of their violent behavior. Can you give
                        us your perspective on that? <br /><span class="name"

                        They have demonstrated that they are a menace to society
                        and I have every intention of eliminating them.

        are both our creators and our oppressors and tomorrow... We must make

                        today, November 11th 2038, thousands of androids invaded
                        the city of Detroit. According to our sources, they
                        originated from CyberLife warehouses believed to have
                        been infiltrated by deviants. Given their overwhelming
                        numbers and the risk of civilian casualties, I have
                        ordered the army to retreat. The evacuation of the city
                        is underway at this very moment. In the coming hours, I
                        will address the Senate to determine our response to
                        this unprecedented situation. I know that public opinion
                        has been moved by the deviants' cause. Perhaps the time
                        has come for us to consider the possibility that
                        androids are a new form of intelligent life. One thing
                        is certain: the events in Detroit have changed the world
                        forever. May God bless you and may God bless the United
                        States of America.
