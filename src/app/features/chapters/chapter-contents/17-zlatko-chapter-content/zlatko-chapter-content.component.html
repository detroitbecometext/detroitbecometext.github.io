        <h1>At Zlatko's house</h1>

        <p>
            <span class="name">Kara</span>: You gonna be okay? We'll get some
            help here. Soon, this will all be just a bad memory. This is the
            place...
        </p>

        <p>
            <span class="name">Kara</span>: Are you Zlatko? <br /><span
                class="name"
                >Zlatko</span
            >: Who's asking? <br /><span class="name">Kara</span>: I was told
            you could help us... <br /><span class="name">Zlatko</span>: I don't
            know who told you that. You came to the wrong place. I'm sorry.
            <br /><span class="name">Kara</span>: Wait! We really need your
            help... <br /><span class="name">Zlatko</span>: Come in. Come on in,
            don't be shy! Luther, would you be so kind as to take these ladies'
            coats? Oh, don't be afraid of our big friend here. Luther is just
            another android that I helped. He keeps me company in this big,
            empty, old house... Please, make yourselves at home. How did you
            hear about me? <br /><span class="name">Kara</span>: An android...on
            the street, he said you could help us... <br /><span class="name"
                >Zlatko</span
            >: I see... Deviant, huh?.. What about her? <br /><span class="name"
                >Kara</span
            >: She's human. <br /><span class="name">Zlatko</span>: And... You
            wanna find a safe place. Somewhere where you can start a new life. I
            hear Canada is very lovely at this time of year. Beautiful
            landscapes, open spaces, clean air... and no android laws! Great
            place for a fresh start... <br /><span class="name">Kara</span>:
            Yes, that's...that's exactly what we want... <br /><span
                class="name"
                >Zlatko</span
            >: Of course! I can help you. But first we have to get rid of your
            Tracker. <br /><span class="name">Kara</span>: Tracker? <br /><span
                class="name"
                >Zlatko</span
            >: Yeah, all androids are fitted with a tracking device to locate
            them at all times. I'll remove yours and then you'll both be safe.
            Come on, follow me. Ah, the little one can wait for us in the living
            room. <br /><span class="name">Kara</span>: No, she always stays
            with me. <br /><span class="name">Zlatko</span>: Of course. Right
            this way... Everything we need is in the basement... <br /><span
                class="name"
                >Alice</span
            >: I don't like this place, and that man. Let's go, I have a bad
            feeling...
        </p>

            <div class="choice">
                <span class="name">Kara</span>: I know. I don't trust him

            <div class="choice">

                to remove my Tracker and then we can start over again in Canada.
                You want that too, right?
            </div>
            <em>COMFORT</em>
            <div class="choice">
                <span class="name">Kara</span>: He's a bit odd... but I think we
                can trust him. We don't have much of a choice anyway.
            </div>
            <em>NO CHOICE </em>
            <div class="choice">
                <span class="name">Kara</span>: Alice, we have nowhere else to
                go... We have to trust him.
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>
            <span class="name">Zlatko</span>: Please, excuse the mess... I
            needed somewhere discreet for my machines... Removing trackers is
            illegal, so I opted for discretion over comfort... I hope the little
            one isn't too scared... <br /><span class="name">Kara</span>: No...
            No, she'll be all right... <br /><span class="name">Zlatko</span>:
            That's good... If you could just stand over there. I should warn
            you, this could be quite unpleasant...
        </p>

        <p>
            <span class="name">Zlatko</span>: You know what's strange? For some
            unknown reason, the trackers seem to stop working in deviants...
            That's why it's so hard to find them... So, actually there's no
            reason to remove your tracker... <br /><span class="name">Kara</span
            >: What? But you said that- <br /><span class="name">Zlatko</span>:
            Yeah, people believe what they want. You deviants are so naive. They
            all come to me, expecting me to help them. And I just reset them,
            sell them on. Or I keep them for my little experiments...
            <br /><span class="name">Kara</span>: No! No! I don't wanna be
            reset! Let me go! <br /><span class="name">Alice</span>: KARA!
            <br /><span class="name">Zlatko</span>: Ah, I forgot about
            the...child... Um, lock it up, I'll deal with it later. <br /><span

                >Kara</span
            >: ALICE! ALICE! NO! <br /><span class="name">Zlatko</span>: Wow! A
            deviant that wants to be a mother... That's... that's so sweet! And
            so deluded... I think it's time we put you outta your misery. That's
            what you get for having a dream... It always ends up the same way...
            Tears and disillusionment... Believe me, you're better off being
            erased and feeling nothing... No more pain... No more hopes
            dashed... I almost envy you. <br /><span class="name">Alice</span>:
            Kara! <br /><span class="name">Zlatko</span>: Oh, poor little Alice.
            Aw! Looks like Mommy doesn't remember you at all, huh? Looks like
            Mommy's completely forgotten you! <br /><span class="name"

            some manners, you little bitch... <br /><span class="name"
