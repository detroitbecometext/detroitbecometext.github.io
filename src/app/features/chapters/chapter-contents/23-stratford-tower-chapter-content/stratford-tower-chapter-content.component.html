            <br /><span class="name">Channel 16 - Michael Webb</span>: Our top
            story tonight: Detroit-based android manufacturer CyberLife has
            officially become the world's first trillion dollar company. With
            more than fifty million androids sold in America alone, the company
            founded by Elijah Kamski just ten years ago has experience the
            fastest economic growth in history. In spite of criticism of the
            impact of androids on human employment and questions concerning its
            semi-monopoly, the success of CyberLife seems destined to continue.
