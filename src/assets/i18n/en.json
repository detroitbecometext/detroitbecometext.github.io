Laura Mendoza (vocals/bass), Jorge Cortez (vocals/ guitar) and Joe Leone (drums) aren’t doing their job if they aren’t tearing the place down. Their M.O. is energy and their tastes are for the seediest, prickliest, raucous roots of rock. With a Detroit Music Award for best hard rock band under their belt and a Punk Rock Night Award out of Indianapolis for best non-local rock band, they aren't just taking Detroit by storm, but the nation as well. Like a raunchy and rambunctious revivalist tent preaching the good word of grime, grit and spirited rock music –way out by the side of some lost highway haunted with druggy drifters, heartbreaking bikers or amped up alt-rock reverent hedonists in need of their fix for hard chugging grooves, pedal-twisted solos and bursting rhythms, White Shag preach from an altar underneath wax effigies of Iggy Pop while paging through newer testaments from Queens Of The Stone Age.",

Juan graduated from Belleville high school in 1980, and went straight to college where he attended Washtenaw community college in Ann Arbor Michigan. There he met Rik Davis. In 1981, Juan & Rik released two singles called “Alleys of your mind” & “Cosmic raindance”. These songs were totally electronically produced tracks which became the birth, beginning & template for a whole new genre of music they called “Techno Music”. This success eventually led to their most successful Cybotron single titled “Clear” released in 1983, which over 20 years later would be sampled by hip hop queen “Missy Elliott” for the song “Lose Control” which hit #1 on billboard magazine’s “Hot 100” chart. The song Clear was being exported to the UK which they dubbed it “Electro” which triggered the global “Techno Music” phenomenon. Techno Music then swept the planet and put Juan, Derrick, Kevin, & Eddie in demand for live performances and DJ gigs all over the world.",

I wanted to make sure we allowed Markus’s theme to shine through in the trailer for E3 because it’s really the first time future players are connecting with him. It’s a perfect platform to give everyone a preview of what struggles Markus (and the player through Markus) are going to experience together. The goal of this track was that music amplifies the struggle while generating interest in Markus’s uncertain future.\" - John Paesano",

I often found myself writing the score of the game much like I would a feature film. We Are People is a track that was rooted in creating a cinematic experience for players. The subject of prejudice and slavery is complicated and dark, but the representation of hope and freedom is so strongly rooted in Markus’s actions that It needed both light and dark moments musically.\" - John Paesano"

Being one of the first tracks I wrote, I aimed to introduce and capture as many thematic ideas as possible. You can hear Connor’s thoughts, movements, curiosities, as well as emotional changes through the arc of the scene and the music. Some of the colors you can hear are, The Connor Guitar, which is a 24 fret guitar like custom instrument created to replicate the inner working of an android, vintage and very very old Moog synthesizers, as well a detuned unplugged electric violin. You hear scratches, ticking, movements, and rubs which with all creates the sound of who Connor is. During gameplay, when the player makes any decision, the track evolves and gets manipulated to reflect these choices.\" - Nima Fakhrara",

What does he represent? And is Connor a true Android? These questions and philosophies were the backings of the Connor Suite’s exploration. The Suite represents all the emotional journeys, the mission, the doubts, the realizations and the disappointments Connor can have. The tools and the colors that helped me capture the sound of Connor was many vintage synthesizers, rare analog and modular synthesizers, as well as non-traditional methods of playing traditional orchestral instruments. The first sound you hear is an old vintage Moog synthesizer that creates a bass rumble melody which merely is Connor, cold, curious, and determined. As the track continues, you can hear lots of unplugged electronic instruments such as an electric guitar, electric bass as well as an unplugged electric string orchestra.\" - Nima Fakhrara",

This game is so cinematic that many times gazing at the screen I forgot that the rain and the snow started life as lines of code – much like Kara herself. I wanted to compose the cold and exposure into the music, but at the same time try to find a way to represent the idea of an internal mental warmth, even the beginnings of love that could maybe make a person, or a developed AI cope with anything from the outside. I wanted to contrast a sense of the bitter cold with a sense of affectionate memory. There’s an orchestral chorus that returns that is meant to feel like the music is breathing in and out, from one chord to the next. Hidden in all of these layers, Kara and Alice’s themes are intertwined in buried melodies.\" - Philip Sheppard",

As a composer, my job is to describe as much as possible, whilst letting the player originate their own reactive feelings – to build their own emotions from fear to ecstasy. That can mean describing everything! Whether the environment, the movement of characters, their physical state, their mental state, even things that are out of shot that are about to happen… there’s a lot to choose from! In this cue, Kara is in real danger, so her theme is just reduced to a violent shudder – the tune itself is violently shaking with fear and cold. The orchestral instruments are highly distorted and even the percussion tracks are constructed from my string players hitting the instruments with their bows. A gig heavy riff builds up, over which Kara’s orchestral theme grows out of 40 separate electric cello lines before descending into a maelstrom of chaos. The cello I’m playing to make the electric solos over the top is actually 250 years old!\" - Philip Sheppard",

He pioneered the concepts of AI and his extraordinary brain still had space for playfulness and deep humour. Marvin was also a brilliant musician, and his wife Gloria and daughter Margaret have given me the gift of working with his recordings of improvisations and compositions at the piano. After he sadly passed away, I had the idea to frame one of my friend’s beautiful pieces with a full orchestra recorded around him in Abbey Road. I know that Marvin would have loved this game, its profound meditations on AI, its multi-linear narratives and its soul.That is why we hid his beautiful music in the game. Marvin wrote the following: To make machines that make movies from scripts, we'll need yet more theories about how our minds work. If you're working with media - that is, with means for changing what others think - you ought to have theories in several other domains - about thinking and reasoning, about memory, about emotions, and about the nature of communication itself.\" - Philip Sheppard",

Mike Morrison of Americana Roots UK says of their new record “Just two albums in to their recording career and I genuinely list the Whiskey Charmers as one of my favourite 21st century bands.” Fans often describe The Whiskey Charmers sound as the feeling of riding through the desert with the top down, or the feeling of being in some lonesome smoky bar off the side of an abandoned highway, or music from a Spaghetti Western. Comparisons have been drawn to The Cowboy Junkies, Mark Knopfler and Loretta Lynn. They may perhaps fall into the Outlaw category in Ameripolitan music, a genre created by the legendary artist Dale Watson. William P Davis (Former Deputy Director of the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum in Nashville) has a different opinion: “I’ve heard a lot of good musicians. The Whiskey Charmers remind me of no one – and, to me, that is one of the best compliments an act can receive.”",

To most people this phrase conjures up visions of Iggy, to others it may bring to mind the recent explosion of bands from the Motor City; but to those in the know, Detroit rock-n-roll means one thing only-Rocket 455. Absolutely, these boys were influenced by the classic \"Detroit sound\"-but Rocket took that sound further; they added to it; they used it only as one of many building blocks in their own amazing sound. Rocket 455 put rock-n-roll back on track and paved the way for the Detroit bands you know today. It's not surprising to anyone in Detroit that the underground music scene has caught up with Rocket 455-twenty years later. Seems these boys are always ahead of their time. Unfortunately, although Rocket is now a music legend within the Motor City's sprawl, rather unjustly they never received the wide-spread recognition they deserved outside this area. They never were able to fully capture on vinyl the mid-western angst-fueled rock-n-roll energy of their live show. This venerable collection of songs is as close as you're going to get to that live show.",

But a spokesperson for NATO is more optimistic: “Both nations stand to benefit from a stable, productive Arctic region. A conflict would benefit nobody”.

A recent study has found that this kind of talking, called ‘command-led communication’, is characterized by instructions and orders rather than persuasion, humor, or intimacy. That adjustment to our everyday speech is altering our brains, with persuasion skills getting weaker through lack of use.",
                    "ARTICLE2": "This is especially true of younger generations. ‘Command-led communication’ has fostered a generation of adolescents with highly limited social skills. In the same study, young people were found to have developed very different communication centers in their brains. Employers have long complained of the difficulty in finding graduates who know how to influence and convince others. But with people (especially young people) spending more and more time with their machines, it’s difficult to see how the situation will improve."

Waterside real estate in once top attractions like Miami and Los Angeles are experiencing “fright flight”, with wealthy residents opting for properties further inland or at higher altitudes. This is driving up prices in once rural areas, and plummeting house values in previously desirable neighborhoods. Whilst this might sound like an opportunity for poorer Americans to enjoy a new lifestyle, the reality is less attractive.",
                    "ARTICLE2": "Coastal properties are not just exposed to regular flooding, hurricanes and other climatic weather – they’re also suffering from ‘urban flight’, with all the services and amenities following richer customers into new areas. Urban Development specialist Arnold Waters calls this “the donut effect”, whereby “the previous centers of coastal cities gets hollowed out”. This census is just the latest example of how climate change is affecting American societies in ways previously not imagined – altering not only the face of our environment, but even the social fabric of our nation."

                    "ARTICLE1": "When a driverless vehicle foresees an accident, the car’s computer makes life and death decisions – for example deciding which of two pedestrians to hit. But the exact process by which cars make these decisions is not very well understood. Martin Forlong, of CrowneCars, tries to clarify: “In these situations, the car’s imaging system gathers data to determine the pedestrian’s age, gender, life expectancy, etc. in the blink of an eye.” This data is parsed through the public record “to determine marital status, employment record, life expectancy and whether they have children.” The car then assigns a ‘value’ to each possible victim based on criteria like their contribution to society: “we put a premium on lives that will save other lives, like doctors and nurses.”",
                    "ARTICLE2": "All this may sound very reasonable. But Felix Gamble, head of Anti-Automation League (AAL) says the system has no right to make such judgements: “Somebody with a criminal record is not necessarily less valuable to society than a doctor. That kind of information is irrelevant to the sanctity of human life.” But Forlong dismisses such claims: “We want our cars to make the best possible choices, and that means acting on the basis of all the information they can gather. The more, the better.”"

Gorganski has linked the amount of time we spend in front of screens with the widespread antidepressant epidemic: “from the time we wake up, to the time we go to bed, we are surrounded by screen-based devices. Of course, too much TV definitely won’t make your eyes go square, but it can have other harmful consequences”. These include poor sleep, strained eyesight and lack of face-to-face interaction driving emotional underdevelopment and depression.",
                    "ARTICLE2": "Gorganski’s study found that 2 in 3 people take antidepressants and lack of social interaction is the leading cause. Meanwhile the average person spends 82% of their time communicating through a device rather than in person and relationships are suffering for it. In response, CyberLife has introduced a “home-psychologist” add-on for your android, in a bid to teach us how to communicate again. The upgrade costs $150 but can benefit the whole family with group therapy sessions and activities adapted for children and adults. But Gorganski is skeptical: “our society is hooked on technology – I don’t think yet more technology is the answer. Just go outside and talk to someone”."

Shortly after, Kamski had disappeared. Ousted as CEO of CyberLife and living in obscurity outside the media glare, the Man of the Century has left the very world that he recreated. Kamski’s story begins in 2018, when commercial property in Detroit was cheap and attracting many start-ups. The college graduate bet what little he had on developing an android prototype and spent years to no avail – until hitting on two breakthroughs: blue blood and biocomponents.",

Yet at the peak of CyberLife’s powers – when the company was approaching a $500bn valuation – rumors emerged that Kamski disagreed with his shareholders over strategy. He later departed under mysterious circumstances. Today, sources claim Kamski is living in a luxurious villa by the water, somewhere on the outskirts of his beloved Detroit, refusing all visitors and spending his time exclusively with androids.

And they are locked in fierce competition to become the world’s predominant Eastern economy, which continues to overtake the western hemisphere by leaps and bounds. CyberLife’s ‘almost-human’ model of android design compliments America’s service economy. Russia and China have also developed androids that reflect their national economies.",
                    "ARTICLE2": "After failing to emulate the blue-blood model of design, Russia’s android manufacturers rely on more traditional construction methods. The resulting machines are less anthropic, but capable of operating in cold and inhospitable conditions. China’s androids use an alternative blue-blood fluid with less upfront power generation, but greater efficiency. The result are androids capable of operating for months without supervision or recharging in China’s vast rural areas. Who is winning the new space race? With everybody going in different directions, it’s too soon to tell."

                    "ARTICLE1": "After decades of android designs that were primitive, robotic, and expensive, CyberLife revolutionized the industry through an innovation of their CEO and visionary Elijah Kamski. Thirium 310 (the chemical name of blue blood, which is a trademark) is a compound vital to the functioning of all CyberLife androids, circulating energy and electrical information throughout the machine’s ‘body’.",
                    "ARTICLE2": "This fluid powers ‘bio-components’, synthetic organs that roughly reflect the organ system of humans. Some of these organs serve important functions (maintain temperature, circulating blue blood, and so on) where others are used to make the androids seem more human (lungs to simulate breathing). As with humans, the loss of blue blood will impair an android’s functions, ultimately resulting in shutdown. Blue blood is essential for CyberLife’s androids’ key selling point: how human they seem. That this wonder chemical (both a power supply and a way of regulating the androids’ internal systems) was developed by one man – who isn’t even a trained chemist – only furthers the myth of Elijah Kamski."

The computer was specifically designed to analyze vast data from various sources and generate predictions. Philip Seymor, CyberLife’s Director of Futurology, is highly confident: “We’ve been testing for a while, and the results are going to wow people.” The computer will be used to calculate the probability of “Mass Extinction Events”, such as aggressive alien invasions or global climate disasters like meteors or superviruses.",

The top speed of 1,800 mph was made possible because the tube travels through a depressurized chamber, providing a near-frictionless environment for its magnetized motors.

They see a chance to keep that NYC salary whilst enjoying an LA lifestyle, and they’re scrambling over each other to take advantage.” Real estate isn’t the only thing shaking up: school places are rapidly filling and suburban retailers are racking up prices in anticipation of all those New York dollars flooding in. Long time Californians are expected to be pushed out from the cities – which is why they’ve been protesting the new line. As one angry demonstrator put it: “First Detroit takes our jobs, then New York takes our homes? When’s it gonna end?”"

Poor men and women, desperate to make ends meet, are vulnerable to become users – or even dealers.”",

Its initial goal is to assist human detectives in their investigations by offering them technological assistance. He is also equipped with a social module which is specially developed to create the \"ideal partner\", capable of integrating into any team. The Connor model includes a physical simulation software based on the analysis of elements of the crime scene. He can thus reconstruct past events by cross-checking the evidence at his disposal. It is also the first model to offer the analysis of biological evidence in real time, by direct sampling and ingestion of samples. The first time a Connor model was used in real-life conditions was part of the investigation on deviants. No date has been given regarding its use by police forces on a larger scale."

Valedictorian of his police academy, he quickly distinguished himself through courage and intellect, solving many difficult investigations. Though he looked set for a brilliant career in the Detroit Police Force, he suffered some kind of cruel setback. Anderson slowly sank into alcoholism and an unpredictable, even suicidal, state of mind which earned him multiple warnings and disciplinary penalties. Always respected and regarded highly by his former colleagues, who know what a brilliant officer he was, but also feared for his bad temper and dry humor, Anderson seems to just want to be left in peace. He has little esteem for humanity in general, preferring the company of his dog. Antisocial, he only ventures out to frequent sleazy bars. One last detail: he hates androids."

This model is highly popular because of its ability to get along with young children. After technical difficulties on the assembly line, which should have led to her disassembly, Kara was sent to a store where she was quickly sold for the first time. She was then resold and changed hands several times before being purchased by a certain Todd Williams. The name “Kara” is thought to have been given to her by Alice, but it is quite possible that it was Kara who first whispered this name to Alice… Having been damaged, following what Todd described as a \"stupid accident\", Kara was sent for repairs several times, where her memory was reset on each occasion..."

Particularly advanced, the YK models are able to simulate the symptoms of several childhood illnesses, on top of cold and fever, but can also replicate pain, sadness, joy, as well as other classic childlike behaviors. Their LEDs can even be deactivated to maintain the perfect illusion. As soon as Kara saw Alice, she obviously knew she was an android, but something in her decided to ignore reality so she could become the mom that Alice had always dreamed of..."

As the deviant revolution reached its climax, the army immediately neutralized all of its android soldiers to avoid any risk of rebellion.
