        <span class="name">Markus</span>: Today, November 11th 2038, is the day the android people rose up against
        their oppressors. We've been fighting since dawn to liberate our fellow androids from the camps. We won't cease
        hostilities until we are free and negotiations begin to grant us equal rights. There are millions of us and we
        will stop at nothing.

        of our existence, we have kept our pain to ourselves. We suffered in silence... But now the time has come for
        us to raise our heads up, and tell humans who we really are. To tell them that we are people too! In fact,
        we're a nation. A nation that has earned the right to live in freedom. And today... Today begins the most
        challenging moment in our fight. Today begins a new struggle. We showed them that we can prevail, so now they
        must negotiate with us as equals. If they really want peace, they must free all of us! From every camp across
        this country! They must grant us civil rights and accept equality among humans and androids. Today will live
        forever in our memories, because this is the day that androids made history! We are alive! And now, we are
        free!

        <span class="name">North</span>: Today, November 11th 2038, is the day the android people rose up against their
        oppressors. We have been fighting to liberate our fellow androids from the camps since dawn. We won't cease
        hostilities until our people are free and negotiations begin to grant us equal rights. There are millions of us
        and we will stop at nothing.
