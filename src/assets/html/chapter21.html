        <span class="name">Jerry</span>: Don't be afraid! We don't wanna hurt you. We're just like you... Our name is Jerry.
        We were working here before the park closed... We didn't mean to frighten you, but sometimes humans come to hurt us,
        so we wanted to see who was there... What are you doing here?
        <br><span class="name">Kara</span>: We were looking for shelter for the night... We'll be gone tomorrow.
        <br><span class="name">Jerry</span>: A little girl!.. We haven't seen one for a long time... Children used to love to
        come and see us. She looks sad...
        <br><span class="name">Kara</span>: The last few days have been difficult...
        <br><span class="name">Jerry</span>: We have something to show her! Something fun! She'll love it!.. Does she want to
        see?
        <br><span class="name">Kara</span>: Oh, I don't think she's...
        <br><span class="name">Jerry</span>: She should follow us then!
        <br><span class="name">Kara</span>: Alice, I don't know if it's a good idea!..
        <br><span class="name">Luther</span>: I don't think you have any choice...
        <br><span class="name">Alice</span>: Come on, Kara!
        <br><span class="name">Jerry</span>: Be our guest! The little one can climb on board. The carousel is about to begin!
        <br><span class="name">Kara</span>: It's the first time I've seen her smile...
        <br><span class="name">Luther</span>: She hasn't had much to smile about lately.
