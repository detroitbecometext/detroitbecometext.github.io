    <h1>At the Eden Club</h1>
    <p>
        <span class="name">Hank</span>: Aw... Feels like somebody's playing with a drill inside my skull... You sure this
        is the place?
        <br><span class="name">Connor</span>: It's the address in the report.
        <br><span class="name">Hank</span>: Right... Okay... Let's get going. Jesus... Sexiest androids in town... Now I
        know why you insisted on coming here ! Oh, boy...
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Looking at the androids for too long</strong>
        <br><span class="name">Hank</span>: Connor! The fuck are you doin'?
        <br><span class="name">Connor</span>: Coming, Lieutenant.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Listening to Ben</strong>
        <br><span class="name">Manager</span>: You're not gonna take my license, are you ? I mean, ha, I had nothing to do
        with this!
        <br><span class="name">Ben</span>: The investigation's ongoing, sir, I can't tell you anything for the moment. Hey,
        Hank!
        <br><span class="name">Hank</span>: Hey, Ben. How's it goin'?
        <br><span class="name">Ben</span>: It's that room there. Oh, uh, by the way... Gavin's in there too.
        <br><span class="name">Hank</span>: Oh, great! A dead body and an asshole, just what I needed...
    </p>

    <h2>
        Inside the room
    </h2>

    <p>
        <span class="name">Gavin</span>: Lieutenant Anderson and his plastic pet... The fuck are you two doin' here?
        <br><span class="name">Connor</span>: We've been assigned all cases involving androids.
        <br><span class="name">Gavin</span>: Oh, yeah? Well, you're wasting your time. Just some pervert who, uh, got more
        action than he could handle.
        <br><span class="name">Hank</span>: We'll have a look anyway, if you don't mind.
        <br><span class="name">Gavin</span>: Come on, let's go... It's uh... starting to stink of booze in here...
        <br><span class="name">Chris</span>: Night, Lieutenant.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Analysing the blood</strong>
        <br><span class="name">Hank</span>: Whoa! Hey! Hey! Hey! Argh, Connor, you're so disgusting... Think I'm gonna puke
        again...
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Hank looking at driver's license</strong>
        <br><span class="name">Hank</span>: Driver's license says: Michael Graham... A credit card, cash in the wallet...
        Picture of his wife and two daughters... I wouldn't want to make that call...
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Reconstructing</strong>
        <br><span class="name">Connor</span>: He didn't die of a heart attack, he was strangled.
        <br><span class="name">Hank</span>: Yeah, I saw the bruising on the neck. Doesn't prove anything though. Could've
        been rough play...
        <br><span class="name">Connor</span>: We're missing something here...
        <br><span class="name">Hank</span>: Think you can read the android's memory? Maybe you can see what happened...
        <br><span class="name">Connor</span>: I can try...
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Connecting to the android</strong>
        <br><span class="name">Connor</span>: The only way to access its memory is to reactivate it.
        <br><span class="name">Hank</span>: Think you can do it?
        <br><span class="name">Connor</span>: It's badly damaged... If I can, it'll only be for a minute, maybe less... I
        just hope it's long enough to learn something.

        Just vanished, we never found out what happened.

        <br><span class="name">Manager</span>: No way... I mean... This is what people appreciate about Eden Club...discretion.
        They can come and go without a trace.
        <br><span class="name">Hank</span>: Sure, sure... Eh, business is booming, right?
        <br><span class="name">Manager</span>: Yeah, can't complain... Good thing about androids is they're up for whatever
        you want, you won't get any diseases and, uh...they won't tell anyone... So, why not go wild?
