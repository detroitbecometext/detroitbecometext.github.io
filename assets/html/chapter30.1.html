        midnight. You absolutely have to be on it. You'll be safer on the other side. It's not much, but it's a start. My brother lives in Ontario, I've given you his address... He'll be able to hide you until things calm down. You're a very brave little girl, Alice. You deserve to be happy. 
        <br><span class="name">Kara</span>: Thank you for everything, Rose.

                <span class="name">KNC - Rosanna Cartland</span>: The authorities have ordered all androids to be delivered
                to the nearest police station or army barracks immediately. If you are worried about your safety, dial the
                number on your screen and the authorities will come to collect your android. Under no circumstances should
                you try to destroy your android yourself. They are unpredictable, and potentially violent.
                <br><span class="name">Channel 16 - Interviewee 1</span>: The android weren't doing any harm.  And the cops just... gunned them down. It was sheer carnage...
                <br><span class="name">Channel 16 - Interviewee 2</span>: There were androids all over the square. A-and
                then the police arrived, and, uh... They opened fire.

                look like... Just- People! People who wanna be free!
                <br><span class="name">KNC - Rosanna Cartland</span>: A new stage has been reached, demonstrating beyond all
                doubt that these defective machines have become a real danger for American society.
                <br><span class="name">CTN TV - Michael Brinkley</span>: The time has come for us to destroy our machines...before
                they destroy us.
                <br><span class="name">Channel 16 - Michael Webb</span>: Without the courage and the determination of the

            are expected. Maybe most worrying of all, our armed forces have lost two thirds of their effective personnel,
            which consisted of specialized android models. The situation is extremely alarming.

            <br><span class="name">Channel 16 - Interviewee 1</span>: It's them or us. We gotta destroy these bastards before
            they kill all of us!

            them! Those things are monsters! Monsters, I tell you!
            <br><span class="name">KNC - Rosanna Cartland</span>: There was a veritable groundswell of violence in Detroit this
            morning. Several hundreds androids took to the streets, destroying everything in their path and threatening the
            lives of any humans they encountered.

            <br><span class="name">CTN TV - Michael Brinkley</span>: The police intervened quickly to quell the rioting but
            they met with the extreme violence of the machines which seemed to be determined to massacre humans.

            <br><span class="name">Channel 16 - Michael Webb</span>: There can be no doubt that the authorities will be pitiless
            in their response to this wave of violence.

        <span class="name">CTN TV - Michael Brinkley</span>: Following the android crisis and the neutralization of all
        military androids, American forces in the Arctic have been forced to withdraw, leaving the way clear for the Russian
        army. But according to some sources, the Russian forces also seem mysteriously to have withdrawn. The Kremlin has
        made no comment for the moment but it is quite possible that the Russian army has been confronted with a similar
        crisis among its own androids. The Chairman of the United Nations, Douglas Cornwell, has called for the organization
        of an international conference on the status of the Arctic. in any case, the danger of a third world war seems to
        have been ruled out... for the moment.
