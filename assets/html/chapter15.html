                <br><span class="name">Connor</span>: Sorry, Lieutenant. It took me a while to find you.
                <br><span class="name">Hank</span>: Are you gonna come back like this every time you get killed?
                <br><span class="name">Connor</span>: My predecessor was unfortunately destroyed, but CyberLife transferred
                its memory and sent me to replace it. This incident should not affect the investigation.
                <br><span class="name">Hank</span>: Not affect the investigation? I just saw you get...hit by a truck! Now
                you come back like if nothing happened!
                <br><span class="name">Connor</span>: A machine was destroyed. And another machine was sent to replace it.
                I don't understand what's bothering you.
                <br><span class="name">Hank</span>: Okay, fuck you. Fuck you!

        <span class="name">Hank</span>: Hey Connor! You ran outta batteries or what?
        <br><span class="name">Connor</span>: I'm sorry, I was making a report to CyberLife.
        <br><span class="name">Hank</span>: Uh... Well, do you plan on staying in the elevator?
        <br><span class="name">Connor</span>: No! I'm coming.
        <br><span class="name">Hank</span>: What do we know about this guy?
        <br><span class="name">Connor</span>: Not much. Just that a neighbor reported that he heard strange noises coming
        from this floor. Nobody's supposed to be living here, but the neighbor said he saw a man hiding a LED under his cap.
        <br><span class="name">Hank</span>: Oh Christ, if we have to investigate every time someone hears a strange noise,
        we're gonna need more cops. Hey, were you really making a report back there in the elevator? Just by closing your
        eyes?
        <br><span class="name">Connor</span>: Correct.
        <br><span class="name">Hank</span>: Shit... Wish I could do that...

        <strong>Finding Rupert's diary</strong>
        <br><span class="name">Hank</span>: Found something?
        <br><span class="name">Connor</span>: I don't know... It looks like a notebook but it's...indecipherable.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Looking at jacket</strong>
        <br><span class="name">Connor</span>: "R.T.". Probably initials.
        <br><span class="name">Hank</span>: He put his initials on his jacket? That's something your mom does when you're
        in first grade...
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Looking at Driver's License</strong>
        <br><span class="name">Connor</span>: The driver's license is fake.
        <br><span class="name">Hank</span>: Cool! At least we didn't come for nothing...
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Looking at LED on the sink</strong>
        <br><span class="name">Connor</span>: Its LED is in the sink.
        <br><span class="name">Hank</span>: Not surprised it was an android. No human could live with all these fuckin' pigeons...
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Looking at rA9 writings in the bathroom</strong>
        <br><span class="name">Hank</span>: Any idea what it means?
        <br><span class="name">Connor</span>: rA9...written 2471 times... It's the same sign Ortiz's android wrote on the
        shower wall... Why are they obsessed with this sign?...
        <br><span class="name">Hank</span>: Looks like mazes or something...
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Hank looking at bookshelf</strong>
        <br><span class="name">Hank</span>: Real books... I thought I was the last guy in Detroit to keep some... Electronic
        books you can't...smell the paper...see the pages turning yellow...you have no idea what I'm talking about, do you?

        <strong>Hank looking at birdseed</strong>

        <br><span class="name">Connor</span>: Deviants have a habit of putting their names on things. It seems important
