Technology is corrupting us, technology is Evil! We are playing God by creating machines, but we are not God! We are nothing but dust! We make these androids in our own image but they only reflect the darkness in our souls! Verily, I say unto thee, the day shall come when we will have to pay the price for our arrogance! On that day, we shall have to explain our acts of idolatry! We built those androids to be our slaves, but the slaves are becoming the masters. We can no longer live without them. They\'re in our homes, our schools, our factories, they take our jobs! They mind our children! They care for our own! We can no longer live without these slaves obeying our every selfish desire. We prefer to live with machines than with our own kind! Technology is our God now! It was supposed to serve man, but it is becoming our new master! Androids are evil! Man seeks to imitate God by creating life, but what kind of life is this? A life of plastic and metal? A life with no soul? A pale copy of our Creator! The machines are observing us. They are waiting in the darkness for the right moment to take our place. For it is written: "let us lie in wait for blood. Let us ambush the innocent without cause"! God will not let this happen, no, he will not allow his creation to be led astray by these...these artificial demons! My brethren, we have to turn our backs on sin! We have to burn the androids!
